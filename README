A few goals:
	- plan & schedule future transactions, based on current balances

SETUP:
- Set up the database by running:
> mkdir -p $HOME/Dropbox/Apps/tjFinanceTrack
> sqlite3 $HOME/Dropbox/Apps/tjFinanceTrack/fintrack.db < fintrack_db.sql
- Put finance_track.py in your path!

TODO:
	- red ink for past transactions still on pending list
	- red ink for amounts in the negative, and ()

When there is a real web interface
	- text box adding at the bottom
	- button to clear transaction


Database Structure
Semi-direct translation of the finance track spreadsheet:
transactions:
	- id
	- date
	- from_account
	- to_account
	- start_balance
	- delta_balance
but then need to reprocess the entire database to generate balances.

Another approach:
accounts:
	- a_id
	- balance
settled_transactions:
	- st_id
	- enter_date
	- post_date
	- from_account
	- to_account
	- delta_balance
pending_transactions:
	- pt_id
	- enter_date
	- post_date
	- from_account
	- to_account
	- delta_balance

Then the setup is:
- Can look at current account balances and build up pending transactions
- Can look at backlog of transactions.
- have a 'roll into settled' button.
